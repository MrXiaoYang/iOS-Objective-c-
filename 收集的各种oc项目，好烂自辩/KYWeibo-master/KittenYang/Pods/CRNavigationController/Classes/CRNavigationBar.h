 * For use for devices running iOS 7.0.3 and later, up to iOS 7.1. This overrides the alpha value of any color
 * passed in to be 70%. Since (starting with this version) the blur effect is ultimately
 * determined by the transparency of the color, setting this to a value other than 1.0f will
 * provide said blurriness. Values between 0.5f and 0.7f seem to work best while still trying
 * to retain most of the desired color. 
 * @warning: Setting this value to 1.0f will reduce blurred translucency significantly.
