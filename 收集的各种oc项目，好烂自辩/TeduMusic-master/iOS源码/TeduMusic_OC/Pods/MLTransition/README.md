MLTransition
============

Support for iOS7+.  

- Pop ViewController with pan gesture from middle or edge of screen.   
- It's useable with setting the `leftBarButtonItem` property of `UIViewController`    
   
Tips:    
The libirary uses a unpublish api(not private). But it's ok in my experience. My app has been approved.
